# Purpose
Implement the interpreted language found at the following tutorial:
1. https://accu.org/journals/overload/26/145/balaam_2510/
2. https://accu.org/journals/overload/26/146/balaam_2532/
3. https://accu.org/journals/overload/26/147/balaam_2565/

Class/function names may be changed 
Code was modified to reflect the next philosophy: the input code is correct, no errors, can be expected, all string literals are closed
 all function calls are followed by closed paranthesis, braces are closed, etc.
